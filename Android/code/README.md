Two examples of android code from my work at Jobinhood. I believe this code is outdated/incomplete as I was only able to get a local copy from an old machine. I no longer have access to the Jobinhood repo.

## ConversationList.java

This is part of a messaging module, the primary function of this class is to build a conversation from a JSON response retrieved by the home server.

## SantiagoAndroid.java

This module handles requests to the home server for information (such as user details) or new messages from the server.
